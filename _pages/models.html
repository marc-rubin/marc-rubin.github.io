<p>The macro models can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OKmoON8NYG0jRjJSzBZI0On1efZ8Amcb?usp=drive_link">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are three files in this folder:
<ol>
  <li>Automated Prototype <b>Excel</b> Model File (toolkit.xlsx). Look to the first tab <i>Table of Contents</i> In the Master Excel file for the nine templates (S.I thru S.IX) that cover the major analytical insights produced by applying the “Tool Kit.”</li>
  <li>Manual Version of Excel File used as the basis for coding up the automated version (master.xlsx). This file could be referenced for instructors who want to dive into the weeds in class and examine the methods for developing the templates (tool kit) from the ground up. This includes all data acquisition and model calculations.</li>
  <li><b>User’s Guide</b> (Word Document) to accompany the Automated Toolkit (to be added). Look to the Table of Contents for the discussion of the specific models covered in the “Tool Kit.” For the most part, each theoretical item in the toolkit is standardized in terms of the relevant model goals, methodologies employed, interpretation on numerical model output, location of the predictor and outcome variables in the spreadsheets and the key working assumptions.</li>
</ol>
