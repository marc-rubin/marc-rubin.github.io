<b>Bio Sketch</b>

Marc Rubin is a recently retired Towson University faculty member who was previously affiliated with the Department of Economics at the University. Rubin joined this institution in 2012, immediately following his retirement from the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce. This relationship continued until May 2023 during which time he specialized in teaching macroeconomics.  Prior employment included various stints in academia teaching economics to undergraduate and graduate students alike. Rubin also worked in the private sector as a project manager for SAIC and Booz, Allen and Hamilton, where he specialized in energy/environmental issues. During his government and academic careers, Rubin published numerous technical reports and peer reviewed articles. The latter appeared in various academic journals, and in the official proceedings of the Joint Economic Committee, United States Congress. His scholarly output at the Census Bureau included numerous studies on the development of NIPA accounts (National Income and Product Accounts) for the U.S. Insular Areas. This work was the basis for receiving the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Highest Civilian Honor: the Gold Medal Award for Scientific/Engineering Achievement (2010). And most importantly, this last NIPA work provided the foundation and was a major source of the expertise involved in the creation of the current macro model spreadsheets and the accompanying User Guide.
Besides the Gold Medal award, professional validation of his data-driven empirical approach began with: the publication his  e-book (Kendall—Hunt 2019); was further demonstrated by his peer-reviewed article published by the Journal of Applied Business and Economics (2019); was re-confirmed by his live presentation of the macro models to scholars attending the AEA/CTREE convention in May 2019, and most recently by giving a lecture at the RMU/W.W. Norton Teaching of Economics Symposium (February 2023). 
Rubin received his undergraduate training in economics at Cornell University (1968) and went on to get the Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania (1977). His original research interest was in comparative economic systems and organizational theory. He spent a year in China (1985-86) as a Fulbright Teaching and Research Fellow at Zhongshan University, and a dissertation field work year in the USSR (1974-75) as an IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board) fellow at the Moscow Institute of the National Economy (Plekhanov Institute).
