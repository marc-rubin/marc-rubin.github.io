<p>Ancillary materials can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-2bYfGm1uA7a7bsr9u8UepzbLyDY3rb?usp=drive_link">here</a>.</p>

<p>This folder contains:
<ol>
  <li>Power Point Lecture File (slides.pptx): These 132 slides comprise a mini course that is referenced to the fourth edition of my e-book and the manually coded master excel file that was used in the development of that text. These materials could assist professors who want to guide students in the mechanics of exploring simple macro models which explain the dynamics of aggregate output and aggregate prices. In principle, analogous slides could be located in the present automated model file and then be developed into a power point presentation, but it is not a cost-effective use of my time because the concepts are the same for lecturing purposes.</li>
  <li>Panopto Videos (see the videos subfolder): There are 8 videos which illustrate the mechanics of crafting the model templates (toolkit) using step-by-step visual instructions. They can be downloaded and accessed with any standard reader.</li>
</ol>
